  <h1>Our Benefits</h1>
  <h2>Low barrier to entry</h2>
  <p>Because Android provides its software development kit for free, developing an app for android is a great way to keep costs down. Android apps are written using Java, an object-oriented programming language in which our developers are extensively trained. Not only does this particular language ensure your app is developed with great attention to detail, but it also means we have the knowledge and tools to develop your app very quickly. Your development costs will be low and you will always meet your deadlines.</p>


  <h2>Multiple deployment options</h2>
  <p>Unlike with iOS development, you don’t have to rely on a single market to deploy your Android app. You have the option to use the Google Play store, but also to make your own sales channels. In other words, you can put it on your website or add it to your own web store. So this allows you to take a broad approach, targeting users in with multiple channels.</p>

  <h2>Easy customization</h2>
  <p>Android’s diverse selection of customization options allows use to build exactly the app you want, without compromise. The development process for Android is specifically designed to allow for feature customization and various integrations. Developing your app for Android is your best option if you want it to be flexible and scalable enough to meet a wide range of business requirements.</p>
