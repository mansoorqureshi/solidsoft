    <h1>Our Services for Testing</h1>
    <h2>Your Website</h2>
    <p>We test everything in detail. Content-managed websites, static sites, and web portals, are just the beginning. We won’t just find and fix individual issues for you—we actively work to make sure your product is as high quality as possible. This will boost your credibility, rack up positive reviews, and keep your users waiting for your next launch.</p>

    <h2>Your Web App</h2>
<p>
  Yes, testing web applications is a more complex process than testing a normal web or ecommerce sites, because they consist of bespoke functionality. Preparing test scripts, conducting each test cycle, re-testing bug fixes, and regression testing, are only a few services we offer. We can do this by ourselves, or integrate with your existing project team and provide high-end quality assurance.

      <h2>Your Mobile App</h2>
    <p>We test native mobile apps across iOS, Android and Windows Mobile devices. Even though these apps might not be very complex, they are subject to the same level of detail as with all our testing. We don’t just give generic advice. In fact, we provide custom recommendations based on your OS version, screen resolution, form factor, and more -- making sure the testing covers your target audience. You’ll be able to submit your app to the AppStore on time and sleep easier knowing that our testing has made it bug-free.</p>
<br>

    <h2>Your Ecommerce Platform</h2>
<p>First, we eliminate all issues that could negatively affect your sales. We thoroughly go over the user experience and fix everything along the way that could possibly get in the way of a user turning into a buyer. We’ll often implement a wide range of fixes at this stage to make sure everything runs smoothly. Finally, we’ll extend the testing across all browsers and platforms, so you reach the broadest possible audience of buyers.</p>
