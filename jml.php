  <h1>Our Benefits</h1>
  <h2>Built-in SEO</h2>
  <p>Joomla comes equipped with search-engine-friendly URLs. These count for a lot in search engine algorithms. Plus, you can potentially spend fewer resources on running SEO campaigns. In addition, Joomla allows you to build meta keywords and descriptions for each page, which allows the search engines to index your site more accurately. These features make Joomla an excellent option for those of you who don’t plan on spending a lot of time or money to develop your SEO. However, it also means that our teams can make Joomla a very powerful tool if you do want to focus on SEO. Try pairing Joomla with our SEO services.</p>

  <h2>Thousands of templates & extensions</h2>
  <p>Joomla comes with templates and extensions for any sort of business or brand. Big or small—it doesn’t matter. Joomla is scalable and offers plenty of options either way. We can find the one that best suits you, or we can hand-build a custom one for you. Because not all templates are free, and not all templates are available across all versions of Joomla, we take the time to find and recommend ones that best match your needs.</p>

  <h2>Easy to scale and optimize</h2>
  <p>One of Joomla’s biggest benefits is how well written its code is. That means that experts can easily access Joomla’s core to make any change that might be necessary. So if you need to optimize or scale your website, we can get that done for you in a very short amount of time. Perfect for if you suddenly need changes made while on deadlines.</p>

  <h1>What We Do</h1>
  <h2>Installation & configuration</h2>
  <p>We get everything up and running, so you don’t have to spend your time and resources doing it. Plus, we’ll make sure everything is optimized before its first use, to prevent you from running into issues later.</p>

  <h2>E-commerce solutions & portals</h2>
  <p>Are you using Joomla for an e-commerce site? Do you need to integrate shopping portals? We’ll customize and scale it according to your needs. Whether that means optimizing an existing store, or building an entirely new one, we’ll get you on your way to greater and greater profits.  </p>

  <h2>Custom development</h2>
  <p>What do you need? We’ll talk to you about how to get your website to the next level. If may mean using a preexisting option, or it may mean you need a custom solution. If that’s the case, we can customize almost any aspect of your Joomla website to make it exactly what you need.  </p>

  <h2>Module customization</h2>
  <p>The scalable and extendable nature of Joomla means it already offers an array of pre-made features. However, you may need some specific features that aren’t offered. If that’s the case, our experienced developers can take care of it for you. Just tell us what you need.</p>

  <h2>Up-to-date syncing</h2>
  <p>We keep everything synced, so there’s never a difference between what you’re seeing on the back-end and what your customers are getting on their end.</p>


  <h2>Maintenance</h2>
