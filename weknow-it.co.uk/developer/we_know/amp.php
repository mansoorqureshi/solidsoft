  <h1>If your web page takes a long load time to load,<br> then your visitors are probably pressing off before <br>they have a
     chance to look at what you’re offering</h1>

  <h1>Advantages</h1>
  <h2>More engagement</h2>
  <p>In today’s digital world, consumers have shorter and shorter attention spans, so you only have a limited time to capture your visitor’s attention. By using Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), you will significantly reduce your users’ waiting time while maintaining the functionality and integrity of your site. That means you’ll get more traffic and the potential for a greater degree of engagement.</p>

  <h2>Better ROI</h2>
  <p>Our developers can get you better ROI by loading your content in such a way that it doesn’t slow down your web pages. If you have pages that are covered in ads or media-rich content, it’s likely that your prospects aren’t just navigating away…they could be using ad blockers and privacy extensions. This can cause them to experience functionality issues with your site, which can hurt sales. By using AMD, you’ll improve advertising ROI by getting more traffic, more engagement, and more conversions.</p>


  <h2>SEO</h2>
  <p>By investing in AMD, we increase your mobile compatibility. Mobile optimization organically enhances your SEO, and users of AMD get marked in search engine results. Customers who know what AMD is will automatically prefer your site.</p>

  <h1>Other Benefits </h1>
  <h2>Lightning fast speed</h2>
  <p>AMP brings your users your content in just a fraction of the time it might take your ordinary pages to load. They’ll appreciate it, and will likely prefer your site over your competitors’.</p>

  <h2>Multi-platform</h2>

  <p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re on desktop or mobile, or which browser you’re using. We design our AMP for all platforms and browsers, so your users can access them from anywhere with ease.</p>

  <h2>Good for advertising</h2>
  <p>With AMP, your ads won’t interrupt your loading times. You’ll get found easier by search engines, engage your readership, and be able to track your traffic easily.</p>
