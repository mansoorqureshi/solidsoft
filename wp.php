<h1>Benefits of using WordPress</h1>

<h2>Search Engines Find You Easily</h2>
<p>WordPress makes it easier for Google and Bing to find you. That’s because WordPress’s code is easy to read and searchable. Also, you can assign keywords to almost every part of your WordPress site—individual pages, images, and posts. And that’s not all—in addition to keywords, you can easily customize the titles, description and tags of each part of the site. In short, WordPress is the perfect tool if you want to get ranked on Google.</p>

<h2>Complete control & customization</h2>
<p>One of the reasons WordPress is so popular is that, when you use it, you get complete customization and control options. Not only is there a wide array of themes and other visual option, but the huge number of WordPress Plug-ins also makes it easy to extend your overall functionality. These Plug-ins range from tools to drive customer engagement to SEO tracking. And the good news is that our WordPress teams are trained their use—meaning that your website will be fully functional and optimized to your specific needs.</p>

<h2>Content Marketing</h2>
<p>WordPress was originally a blogging platform. It’s moved beyond that now, but it still allows you to easily generate high-quality content to get picked up by search engines. For added capability, set up an email subscription and add user comments to drive customer engagement.</p>

<h2>Manage it anywhere</h2>
<p>WordPress is browser-based, so you can manage it from any computer, phone or laptop. If there’s a simple update to your website that only needs a few minutes of your attention, you can deal with it anytime, anywhere. Or, for bigger issues, we can manage it for you—and you can see the changes take place from your location. Either way, the control is yours.</p>
